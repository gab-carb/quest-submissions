1.Define your own contract that stores a dictionary of resources. Add a function to get a reference to one of the resources in the dictionary.

2.Create a script that reads information from that resource using the reference from the function you defined in part 1.

3.Explain, in your own words, why references can be useful in Cadence.

With references you don't have to move ressources around, you can just point to it.
Making it easier to know where your ressources are at all time.
And also simpler when used with dictionnaries, since you don't have to force unwrap the returned key value.
