Chapter 3 Day 4 - Resource/Struct Interfaces

1.Explain, in your own words, the 2 things resource interfaces can be used for:

-Resource interfaces allows you to make a ressource conform to certain requirements defined by interface.
-Resource interfaces also give you the ability to constrain resources to the parameters of the interface.
 Even making it impossible to access data from a resource within the bounderies of an interface.
 

2.Define your own contract. Make your own resource interface and a resource that implements the interface. Create 2 functions. 
In the 1st function, show an example of not restricting the type of the resource and accessing its content. 
In the 2nd function, show an example of restricting the type of the resource and NOT being able to access its content.
